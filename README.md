# What I've done so far

- First 8 chapters of the Rust Programming Language Book
    - Redone the first 4 chapters in the Rust Book Experiment (the one with the quizzes) to be sure I understand Rust.

- Implemented the minimax algorithm for a 3 by 3 tic-tac-toe
    - Code still looks like someone tried to write C++ in Rust, there are some monstrosity of code in there but runs okay!
